# State of the project

## What's working?

- can play to some games
- can save (local storage = in your browser) your sheet state
- have different placeholders: 
    - text (static, readonly)
    - checkbox/checkbox bar (for example for Call of Cthulhu v7 we can use this for life point)
    - textarea (for multiline text input)
    - computed input (for value that depends from other ones)
- a simple dice roller
- Save with Ctrl+Shift+s
- free note zone (for taking notes during a session)
- share link: will offer a way to make someone else our sheet (without server)
- radio element (grouped) with differents visual shape (cross, circle, square)

## What's next?

- Save needed indicator (when data are changed and we have not saved yet)
- import/export feature
- print mode (convert editable field as static field, make multiple page on column, make it fit in A4 pages)
- can keep more than one character for one particular game for one user
- a sheet builder assistant (because it's really boring to make it through json...)
- insert image (character photo), should be save as Base64 to have no external files + resize/compress to be lightweight
- home page with product presentation
- replace local storage by IndexedDB
